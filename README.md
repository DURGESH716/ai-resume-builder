## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Even before the pandemic started, students and job-seekers struggled to make themselves stand out from thousands of other applicants. 
<br><br>Unfortunately, not many people know that there is no “one-size-fits-all” resume that they can submit to every company and role they apply to. <br><br>We want to build an app that allows users to build different resumes that are tailored to the company or role they are applying for. For example, if I apply to a Data Science position role at Make School, I should focus on presenting experiences, projects, certifications, etc. that highlight my data science skills as well as any experience that is related to edtech, like tutoring.
